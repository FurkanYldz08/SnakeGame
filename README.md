Hello!

I have created a basic game called "Snake Game(Yılan Oyunu in Turkish)" with using python.
The game is very simple, I think everybody knows how to play snake game.
If you lose, you can quit by pressing Q and try again by pressing C

HOW TO OPEN:

1-Open VSCODE

2-Create a Python file and paste the code in it

3-Open the terminal in vscode

4-Install the pygame library by running "pip install pygame" command in terminal

5-Go to the location of your file in terminal

6-Run the game by running "python yılanoyun.py" command in terminal(yılanoyun is my file name. You should type your filename.)

ENJOY!
